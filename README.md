# LionKingAssembly
Assembly Lion King game developed for x8086 processors. Advanced assembly code, written in 2008.

First major project I did on .asm , added some GUI capabilities as well.
This is a very basic 'child-ish' computer game which demostrates Simba fighting the hyneas.

Fell free to comment, fork, start, etc.

Enjoy !
